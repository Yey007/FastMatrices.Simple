# FastMatrices.Simple
For those of us that don't need generics.

This is essentially what the FastMatrices library used to be. 
Not everyone needs generic support, so I decided to make a simpler version.

This version will be actively maintained but priority is on the more
"advanced" version so features may not be added as quickly.
